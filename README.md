**Physically-based path tracer for production rendering**


This will use [Universal Shading Language](http://github.com/UniversalShading) and its **VM** for both CPU and GPU shading. It may integrated to [Graphics Kernel](https://github.com/recp/gk) or may stay sepate...

Until USL (UniversalShadingLanguage) is finished, I may use `C` for shading.

There is also [Physics Engine](https://github.com/recp/phy) which I'm workig on. I'll update the repo by time. Finishing [Universal Shading Language](http://github.com/UniversalShading) is critical step.
